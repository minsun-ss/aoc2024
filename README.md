# AOC 2024

Every year I think I want to do this in a different language and I get ultra lazy and go back to python. Here's 2024's attempt, but this time python to get the logic and validation out of the way and C++ for the real practice.

# Some thoughts

I have dispensed with the map, imports etc stuff nowadays in python. These days I'm very into just using standard library if I can get away with it in general, or better yet, no imports at all, standard
or otherwise. If I can get a puzzle done with zero imports, even better, although towards the end I was using lru_cache quite a bit. functools, itertools, and collections continue to remain all time
favs. 

I rewrote pretty much every function by hand with every puzzle, no copy paste from previous puzzles. I think I implemented some variant of BFS something like... 4 or 5 times? 

As always, 1 or 2 puzzles where I was absolutely stumped:   

- Day 19 - this time was truly stuck becuase not great at dynamic programming. Had to read a working solution in order to understand it. To add to study.
- Day 20 part 2 - didn't require help on the solving part, but was completely and utterly confused with its wording and once that cleared up, it was doable. 

Some notes for later:
- optimize 6 and 20, they take too long. 6 has an easy one, 20 I have to think about.

This is the second year I finished all 50 puzzles in full within the year, albeit not within the 25 advent days. Happy with that even though it did mean I did the last 8 or so days in the space of 2-3.
