# AOC 2024

Every year I think I want to do this in a different language and I get ultra lazy and go back to python. Here's 2024's attempt, but this time python to get the logic and validation out of the way and C++ for the real practice.

# Some thoughts

I have dispensed with the map stuff nowadays in python. If I can get the puzzle done with zero imports, even better.

Day 19 - this time was truly stuck becuase not great at dynamic programming. Had to read a working solution in order to understand it. To add to study.
